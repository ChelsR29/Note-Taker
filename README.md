# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description

This Note Taker Application uses an express.js back end and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file. This project was built to help me understand express.js. More specifically, how to create routes and connect it to front end code. Furthermore, I learned how to deploy applications with Heroku.
